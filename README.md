During my first year of university, I developed a logic game that I thought was an excellent job. What I learned in my work proved how much it wasn’t, so I further developed it. I redesigned the Object-oriented programming (OOP) specifications and added save and load options to the functions.

In a programmer’s life, it often comes up in which languages software can develop and my opinion has always been that it is not the language that matters but the way of thinking. To prove this, I started rewriting the game in several languages and the following versions have been made so far.
